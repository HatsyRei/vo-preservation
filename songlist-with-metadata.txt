Misc info    : 1) The album itself is titled 'Up Close To Me'. The song title '나에게 가까이' also translates to something similar.
               2) Alas, the original Pixiv art source has been removed. The artist profile is still intact:

               Currently assuming they've renamed themselves in the past, and remove some art from their Pixiv profile.
