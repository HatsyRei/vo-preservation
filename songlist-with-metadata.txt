               2) '2013/08/06' is not actually the title of the soundtrack, but rather the date it was posted by Katsudou Shashin on SoundCloud.
                  The soundtrack is still nameless, up to this day. It can be identified as '#4' as well, on Katsudou Shashin's SoundCloud profile.

Title        : Aer - 雨冷え
Upload date  : Jun 16, 2015
YT ID        : e3smXfaIHxs
Track source : https://soundcloud.com/aaer/amabie
Art source   : https://konachan.com/post/show/192760
Misc info    : 1) Quoting Squiggl3 in the comments, this track is the original piece '雨冷え' by Acua-piece, who is also known as Mizusato on Soundcloud.
                  https://acua-piece.bandcamp.com/track/--18
                  It is currently unclear as to whether Mizusato ever assumed the username 'Aer' on SoundCloud,
                  though it is worth noting that their SoundCloud profile identifier is 'aaer'.
               2) The illustration artist is named '冬馬来彩' (Touma Kisa). While the original illustration has been removed from their Pixiv profile,
                  the Pixiv account of the artist is still intact: https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/3088169

Title        : Sungkyung Kim - 그 밤.

YT ID        : GIElOBwYRCo
Track source : https://soundcloud.com/love-wave-1/aom8fdbdsnhu
Art source   : https://www.zerochan.net/1863407
Misc info    : 1) Sungkyung Kim is also known as 'Lovewave' in some circles. '그 밤.' translates to 'The Night'.
                  The dot behind the video title does not appear to be part of the actual song title.
               2) The artist of the illustration used is "Yong Kit Lam". According to WayBack Machine, they removed their Pixiv account somewhere between 2016 and 2017.
                  After some research, it appears that they've quit Pixiv permanently after admitting to accusations of plagiarism.
                  Yong Kit Lam's apology can be read here: https://www.facebook.com/yongkit.lam.9/posts/1816400871938486

Art source   : https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8e/48/05/8e4805d10cf005b12f54b3416cff2299.jpg
Misc info    : The illustrator of the cover art is '韩一杰' (Han Yi Jie): https://danbooru.donmai.us/artists/102207
               While the Pixiv profile of the artist, as well as their other social media accounts
               are still up and running, this particular artwork is somewhat shrouded in mystery. The artwork is missing from Pixiv as well as
               from hanyijie.lofter.com. Versions available in zerochan, sankakucomplex are not at full resolution (only 1150x704).
               I managed to find one version of it at 1680x1027 (see art source above), but this was a repost on pinterest and nowhere else.
               Considering it wasn't captured in Danbooru, I hypothesize that it was never posted to Pixiv. The watermark suggests that the high res version was
               posted to hanyijie.lofter.com, and later removed for unknown reasons. Sources like anime-pictures.net suggest that the illustration was created
               in 2012. The only place I have yet to search would be the artist's Weibo profile.

Misc info    : By the GODS. This was one tough reverse lookup for the original source of illustration. Yandex, Google and SauceNAO gave no meaningful results.
               I tried tuning down the image saturation, reorienting, etc to no avail. Spent hours going through tons of illustrations with the 'teddy bear' tag in them.
               Heart skipped a beat when it showed up on sankakucomplex. The artist is 'Nomiya', 'nomiya (no 38)'. Original source removed from Pixiv,
               but artist Pixiv profile still intact: https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/2168501
