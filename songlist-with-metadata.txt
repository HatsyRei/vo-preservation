                  but I haven't been able to view anything other than the cropped thumbnail of the illustration there.

Misc info    : The illustration artist is 'Akimiya', and while the artist has a Pixiv account, 
               the original source of this image appears to have been posted in their Deviantart profile instead.
               Akimiya appears to have went by the name 'ピアノ' (Piano) previously. They are also known as 'Agneschen'.
               After a while of hiatus, Akimiya has expressed on Twitter (15 Jul 2020) that they intend to get back into working on illustrations.

               2) '2013/08/06' is not actually the title of the soundtrack, but rather the date it was posted by Katsudou Shashin on SoundCloud.
                  The soundtrack is still nameless, up to this day. It can be identified as '#4' as well, on Katsudou Shashin's SoundCloud profile.

Title        : Aer - 雨冷え
Upload date  : Jun 16, 2015
YT ID        : e3smXfaIHxs
Track source : https://soundcloud.com/aaer/amabie
Art source   : https://konachan.com/post/show/192760
Misc info    : 1) Quoting Squiggl3 in the comments, this track is the original piece '雨冷え' by Acua-piece, who is also known as Mizusato on Soundcloud.
                  https://acua-piece.bandcamp.com/track/--18
                  It is currently unclear as to whether Mizusato ever assumed the username 'Aer' on SoundCloud,
                  though it is worth noting that their SoundCloud profile identifier is 'aaer'.
               2) The illustration artist is named '冬馬来彩' (Touma Kisa). While the original illustration has been removed from their Pixiv profile,
                  the Pixiv account of the artist is still intact: https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/3088169

Track source : https://soundcloud.com/love-wave-1/aom8fdbdsnhu
Art source   : https://www.zerochan.net/1863407
Misc info    : 1) Sungkyung Kim is also known as 'Lovewave' in some circles. '그 밤.' translates to 'The Night'.
                  The dot behind the video title does not appear to be part of the actual song title.
               2) The artist of the illustration used is "Yong Kit Lam". According to WayBack Machine, they removed their Pixiv account somewhere between 2016 and 2017.
                  After some research, it appears that they've quit Pixiv permanently after admitting to accusations of plagiarism.
                  Yong Kit Lam's apology can be read here: https://www.facebook.com/yongkit.lam.9/posts/1816400871938486

Art source   : https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8e/48/05/8e4805d10cf005b12f54b3416cff2299.jpg
Misc info    : The illustrator of the cover art is '韩一杰' (Han Yi Jie): https://danbooru.donmai.us/artists/102207
               While the Pixiv profile of the artist, as well as their other social media accounts are still up and running, 
               this particular artwork is somewhat shrouded in mystery. The artwork is missing from Pixiv as well as
               from hanyijie.lofter.com. Versions available in zerochan, sankakucomplex are not at full resolution (only 1150x704).
               I managed to find one version of it at 1680x1027 (see art source above), but this was a repost on pinterest and nowhere else.
               Considering it wasn't captured in Danbooru, I hypothesize that it was never posted to Pixiv. The watermark suggests that the high res version was
               posted to hanyijie.lofter.com, and later removed for unknown reasons. Sources like anime-pictures.net suggest that the illustration was created
               in 2012. The only place I have yet to search would be the artist's Weibo profile.

Misc info    : By the GODS. This was one tough reverse lookup for the original source of illustration. Yandex, Google and SauceNAO gave no meaningful results.
               I tried tuning down the image saturation, reorienting, etc to no avail. Spent hours going through tons of illustrations with the 'teddy bear' tag in them.
               Heart skipped a beat when it showed up on sankakucomplex. The artist is 'Nomiya', 'nomiya (no 38)'. Original source removed from Pixiv,
               but artist Pixiv profile still intact: https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/2168501

               This upload by Serro seems to be a repost of Voiced Out's upload.

Misc info    : Illustrator is known as 'aya (star)' on danbooru, gelbooru, etc. Looking at Pixiv's navirank (2186509) history though,
               the artist was known as 'e h l' from 2012 to 2016, then '峠' from 2016 to 2018, and '0' in 2019. 
               Their last artwork is titled '再见，', perhaps hinting towards their eventual departure.
               Their Pixiv account no longer exists. https://danbooru.donmai.us/artists/75161

Misc info    : 1) The original track source could not be identified. Various sites which sell the album lists Dark Adaptation as 4 minutes and 30 seconds long,
                  this tallies with what Voiced Out uploaded. The max length of free samples other than Voiced Out's video is only 4 minutes and 9 seconds
                  long. It is unclear how Voiced Out obtained the uncut version of this track. An educated guess would be that it was at some point available on
                  SoundCloud for free.
               2) Another video removed from Voiced Out's channel, presumably around July, 2023.
               3) Reuploaded by Cold Sensor: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyZUpafQehI

               4) I can't believe I actually located the track source... The main problem was the track title is in katakana: セ​ン​チ​ネ​ル, in album 旅​す​る​コ​ド​モ
                  and yes, the artist is titled "Dong", a Japanese chiptune producer according to

               2) While info on Ike Slimster is not lacking, that for the song titled "Never Never", however, is incredibly scarce.
                  As of now, the only video aside from Voiced Out's featuring this track consists of a blend of many tracks,
                  among which Ike Slimster's work was part of: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEyDbxNziRo
                  A guess would be that this track was at some point available on SoundCloud, but then removed later on.

                  "I always come back to this.
                  Back when you were more active, my family was in a bad situation so we had to live with our cousins for a good while. 
                  It was crowded, but they were very kind. The room I was sharing with them didn't have a chair for the desk. 
                  I didn't want to take up any more room then I had already. I'd kneel for hours to do homework or draw and when I was dead tired, 
                  I'd boot up my VoicedOut playlist and lie on the floor. This among other uploads were my solace on a long, crappy day. 
                  A quiet clearing for my thoughts to rest. Another reason to tolerate difficult times. 
                  So thanks again, man.  Hope you're doing well and if not, keep on going o/"
