The Voiced Out Preservation Project

Founded in 2011, Voiced Out is a YouTube channel which shares videos featuring mellow, breezy tunes paired with handpicked artwork, which they feel, complements or embodies the particular tune. While creating videos by placing imagery on top of music is a feat easily accomplished by many given the appropriate tools, Voiced Out has the unique ability of performing such craft better than anyone else. Albeit their lack of interaction with tens of thousands of loyal listeners they have amassed over the years, Voiced Out has been frequently dubbed by many as one of the kindest corners of the internet, a sanctuary for kindred spirits who wish for respite.

The Voiced Out Preservation Project aims to hold a record of tracks and illustrations which have been shared by Voiced Out.
